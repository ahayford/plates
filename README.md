Mobile web app to calculate plates for a barbell.  Great for people who don't have time to do math in a gym.  Check it out at http://henrythach.github.io/plates.

**For iOS Safari users:** Tap the share button and choose "Add to Home Screen".  This will add an icon to your home screen and you can use the app full screen.
